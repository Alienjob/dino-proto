# Test Task for DinoLab

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture**: The project is structured into distinct layers: model, view, application, and service.
- **Pure Interfaces**: Interfaces are defined in the model layer and implemented in the service layer, ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection**: Automated dependency injection is used to manage dependencies efficiently.
- **State Management with BLoC**: The application layer is built using the BLoC pattern to manage the application state.
- **Standardized API Integration**: Retrofit code generation is used to standardize API interactions.
- **Functional Error Handling**: Errors and exceptions are handled in a functional style, treating them as part of the normal application flow.
- **Youthful Design**: The design is fun, colorful, and tailored for a younger audience.

## JavaScript channels implementation

This "Task" screen demonstrates the communication between Flutter and JavaScript code, which is crucial as the company aims to integrate existing JavaScript components into the application.

- An existing JavaScript game was integrated into the app using a WebView.
- JavaScript channels were configured to facilitate two-way communication between Flutter and JavaScript.
- Minor modifications were made to the game to allow data exchange between the WebView and Flutter.

*(Note: The JavaScript game is taken from "Coding By CodingNepal - youtube.com/codingnepal", and I hope this is acceptable.)*
